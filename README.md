## About This Repository (English)

This repository contains a collection of cybersecurity labs, vulnerability reports, and practical exercises developed during my training in ethical hacking and cybersecurity.

All content is based on controlled laboratory environments such as Metasploitable2, DVWA, and intentionally vulnerable services.  
The purpose of this repository is strictly educational.

This repository demonstrates:
- Hands-on penetration testing skills
- Identification and exploitation of common vulnerabilities
- Clear and structured technical documentation
- Ethical and responsible security practices
